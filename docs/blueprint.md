## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon green (#39FF14) to emphasize the "hacker" theme. This color is vibrant and energetic and aligns with the fun, albeit fake, intensity of the site.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#121212) to give a stylish, modern, and dark hacker theme. Desaturated to 20% of the primary hue.
- Accent color: Bright red (#FF3131), for highlighting error messages and calls to action; chosen for high contrast
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of text. For the body text in the forms where the paragraphs are more lengthy, use 'Inter'.
- Animated typing effect in the header to simulate hacking activities, enhancing the prank effect.
- Smooth hover effects on buttons and cards to give a modern feel.
- Use of neon glowing icons related to hacking and social media platforms.
